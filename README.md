This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Note:

- I left out responsiveness, other parts of the GitHub issues page, and end-to-end testing with Cypress because I didn't have enough time.
- I love Styled Components but I had to use Chakra UI to do a lot of the styling heavy lifting.

## How to run

In the project directory, run:

### `npm install`

and then:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br /> Open
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

To run the tests, run:
